## 'RSS-agregator'
I present to you RSS-agregator (Rich Site Summary).
RSS is a specialized format designed to describe news feeds, article announcements and other materials. This is the easiest way for sites (usually blogs) to allow users to subscribe to changes. For this, special services called RSS aggregators are used. These services can poll sitesâ€™ RSS feeds for new posts and display them in a convenient form, marking what has been read, and so on.
